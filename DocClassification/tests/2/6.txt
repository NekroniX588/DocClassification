Will both engagements be captured within one SOW? We need to submit a triage. This will 
also need to go to Lino and Cory Millar for approval. I will need the cost center that will be 
charged for Cory. I will book you for a 15 min meeting to create the triage.

Hi Christine,

FYI, we've asked AJ to produce an SoW to support continuation of Crush through 2019 (estimated at $175k) and a book 
of prepaid hours for Simulator development (estimated at $25K).

Anything we need to do to prepare a VEF on your end, or other vendor management related steps?   For additional 
context, this is just a continuation of the same services with an extension of payment. Also, the Platform is live and 
covered by TRMIS (we just completed our BTRA). Funding will need to be paid out of 2019 efforts ($150 this year, and 
remaining $50 next year). 

Appreciate your help - let me know if a conversation is needed.

Thanks,
Chris
