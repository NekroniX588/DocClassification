Hi Fahad,

 

I have a couple questions regarding this TIP request in order to ensure the correct BTRM is assigned. NGP MAL code indicated in the request is not valid; could you please clarify which TD application is being impacted by this project? Do  you have any documentation (e.g. scope deck, high level ABP, etc) that could be sent for review? 

Best regards,
