+ Doug Miraglia (PM) so Doug can validate the dates in the PCR. I was on PTO and there were eTreasury planning 
discussion.

Doug if the dates documented are still valid estimated dates then I approve this PCR.

Thanks,
Linda

Hello,

The attached PCR is being submitted for your approval. This PCR will extend the current Tranche for the eTreasury 
Upgrade from 11/30/18 to 1/31/19. This extension is required to allow the business to shift their currently scheduled 
10/17 launch date to 11/9 (contingency 11/12) due to delays in their new platform release.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nicole
