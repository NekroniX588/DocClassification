. TSYS Rewards Platform . TSYS is switching TDs credit card services to their new DEP (Digital engagement Platform). Currently, TD credit card customers use link on the public site  and the Universal APP to access a branded experience at TSYS to access their credit card accounts, card services, and care reward programs/benefits. This is accomplished with separate credentials for the credit card site. In conjunction with the upgrade to the DEP site, TD would like to add links to DEP to the secure browser and mobile experiences; and allow users to access their accounts and rewards on DEP via a single sign on (SSO) from online banking. This would allow all credit card customers to access DEP, even if they have not previously created credentials.
